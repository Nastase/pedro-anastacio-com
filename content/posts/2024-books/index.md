One of my favorite hobbies is reading, and in 2024, I reached a personal milestone: I read a record total of 26 books. While not all of them were lengthy epics—some were shorter novellas—each book offered something unique. My reading choices spanned across thrillers and science-fiction to insightful non-fiction, primarily focused on productivity and entrepreneurship.

Among all the books I read last year, two stood out: **"The Murderbot Diaries"** in fiction (ok, this is a series, and I’m currently on volume five out of seven) and **"Working Backwards"** in non-fiction.

## Fiction: "The Murderbot Diaries" by Martha Wells

This series, that starts with *[All Systems Red](https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B01MYZ8X5C?crid=24259DZNWKH7X&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RsoM5E7Fr28SpxeaybUBvTxoffXLVe76XcLgDLFO3qS9SbDMsiJb-Y1EDc784QVh1IW13uuHeXNCRk_VBHxt3g23mK2IKQYsXMKThPMlLZqK28DSx2wrPvf0vAXbg0hibeJoLtz3hRgMbdm8yF3eG8AlnQH4lHOmHNV1NpCTSLfl3DQn63qQV-BserKL8VJU8CevrfihUDBKiH-VQbKexH22B6Ns4-chk_JJrmy5d6U.FQ5MQh0b9spd2rewP1sS6irhJaFeAfJIfJieCVStbUM&dib_tag=se&keywords=all+systems+red&qid=1737135452&sprefix=all+systems+red%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-1)*, follows Murderbot, a sentient security android that has hacked its own governor module, granting it independence over its previous owner, one of the ruthless companies operating in the Corporation Rim

Murderbot prefers the comfort of watching entertainment over interacting with humans (please do not try to touch it, you could provoke a stroke - I mean, if it had a real heart beating). However, it frequently finds itself entangled in human issues — often unwillingly solving problems and uncovering conspiracies along the way.

For me, what makes this series particularly compelling is its blend of action, humor, and introspection. Though Martha Wells writes in an accessible and fast-paced style, she delves into profound themes like:

- **Identity & Autonomy** – How does one define themselves when external forces dictate their existence?
- **Human-AI Relationships** – Can trust exist between artificial intelligence and humans?
- **Ethical Dilemmas** – Who controls technology, and what are the implications of that control?

Despite its lighthearted and entertaining tone, *The Murderbot Diaries* made me reflect on one's purpose, free will, and the implications of technological innovation, making it an absolute standout in my 2024 reading list.

## Non-Fiction: "Working Backwards" by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr

![Working Backwards - Colin Bryar and Bill Carr](/posts/2024-books/images/working-backwards_colin-bryar_bill-carr.jpg)

Recommended by my dear friend and former boss, [Peter Birkholm-Buch](https://birkholm-buch.dk/), *[Working Backwards](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets-ebook/dp/B08BYCQBZN?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yvPFiNji6EJta2Nen7Fhq40A-wltJDiKPBLY_K16L-MzRKjAluXTEFO-VuyS2WkxcHzSl9f8g25eGsPevsDB0ubnw2VgldnpIFVCCyJC6cazYiE2paEyvVYupjILApYgzEmS-yiz1d7eBTArNBgFyZlt1ahu_zs4Qf87-W3-OrgXwnr_DSeOJgQ0K00lfnlOddE1ZcsyUjDP0ZotLSSBzMYbTmKqItdwqeSNDjLFxjE.O8ime48Gn0b18qEjAZmp1DzCH6XpIOS7NEzptNHu-30&qid=1737135508&sr=8-1)* provides an insightful, behind-the-scenes, look at Amazon’s rise from a small online bookstore to the global super-power it is today. Written by two longtime Amazon executives (or "Amazonians," as they refer to themselves), the book serves as both a memoir and a business strategy guide, delving into Amazon’s leadership principles and operational methodologies.

The book excels at showcasing the pillars of Amazon’s success:

- **Customer Obsession** – Every decision is centered on maximizing value for the customer.
- **Operational Excellence** – How Amazon enforces structured, data-driven strategies to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Innovation at Scale** – Amazon fosters a culture of experimentation, where numerous ideas are tested, refined, or discarded before reaching the public.

One of the book’s most valuable insights is the concept of *working backwards* (hence the book's name) — where the teams start with the desired customer outcome and design products or services to fulfill that vision. This methodology challenges conventional approaches, emphasizing intentional, well-researched, data-backed innovation.

This privileged peek at Amazon’s journey, Jeff Bezos’s mindset, and the company’s relentless pursuit of excellence, seen through the eyes and experience of two of the responsible for Amazon's huge success, has given me numerous insights and ideas, making me rethink how I approach problems and project execution.

Amongst all the books I read last year, both *The Murderbot Diaries* and *Working Backwards* left a significant impact on me, offering valuable lessons — one through the lens of an AI struggling with autonomy and his place in the universe, and the other through the story of a company redefining business innovation. 

If you haven't read any of those, you should grab a copy *asap*!
