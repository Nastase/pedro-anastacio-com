&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, &lt;em&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/em&gt; has dominated how product teams think about new ideas. MVP became the default for startups, founders, and even internal innovation teams: build something tiny, ship it early, validate quickly, iterate relentlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, it makes perfect sense. However, in practice&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve stretched &amp;ldquo;minimum&amp;rdquo; to a breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, MVP became an excuse to launch half-working demos disguised as products. Teams optimized for speed, not usefulness. Users got the short end of the stick — expected to test unfinished tools, provide feedback, and patiently wait while we &amp;ldquo;iterate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The books that most impressed me in 2024</title><link>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/2024-books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/2024-books/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/2024-books/images/book_glasses.jpg" alt="Empathic Leader"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite hobbies is reading, and in 2024, I reached a personal milestone: I read a record total of 26 books. While not all of them were lengthy epics—some were shorter novellas—each book offered something unique. My reading choices spanned across thrillers and science-fiction to insightful non-fiction, primarily focused on productivity and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all the books I read last year, two stood out: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Murderbot Diaries&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in fiction (ok, this is a series, and I’m currently on volume five out of seven) and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Working Backwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in non-fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Empathy is the New Strength in Leadership</title><link>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/images/empathic-leader.jpg" alt="Empathic Leader"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once seen as the foundation of good leadership, authority and technical skills are gradually being perceived as the tools of &amp;ldquo;old school leaders&amp;rdquo;. Technical expertise in an area of expertise is still imensly valuable, but on the other hand, authority is being replaced by empathy. Often dismissed as a mere soft skill, empahty is now redefining what it means to lead effectively in modern organizations. And it’s becoming essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
