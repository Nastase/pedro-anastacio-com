In this post, I explore why MVPs often fail in practice and how the SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete) framework offers a better, more user-centered way to build products people actually love and adopt from day one.</small><p class=post-date>November 25, 2025</p><ul class=post-tags><li class=post-tag><a href=https://pedroanastacio.com/tags/product-design>product design</a></li><li class=post-tag><a href=https://pedroanastacio.com/tags/software-engineering>software engineering</a></li></ul></div><div class=post-content><p><img src=/posts/slc-vs-mvp-products-users-love/images/meeting_new_product.png alt="New Product Meeting"></p><p>For more than a decade, <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> has dominated how product teams think about new ideas. MVP became the default for startups, founders, and even internal innovation teams: build something tiny, ship it early, validate quickly, iterate relentlessly.</p><p>On paper, it makes perfect sense. However, in practice&mldr; we&rsquo;ve stretched &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; to a breaking point.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, MVP became an excuse to launch half-working demos disguised as products. Teams optimized for speed, not usefulness. Users got the short end of the stick — expected to test unfinished tools, provide feedback, and patiently wait while we &ldquo;iterate.&rdquo;</p><p>The industry&rsquo;s obsession with MVP has delivered countless prototypes, but far fewer products people really <em>want</em> to use.</p><p>Thankfully, MVP isn&rsquo;t the only way. And in many cases, it&rsquo;s not even the <em>best</em> way.</p><p>On my readings through the immense web, I&rsquo;v stumbled upon a better, more user-centered approach: <strong>SLC — Simple, Lovable, Complete.</strong><br>Originally proposed by Jason Cohen, SLC redefines what &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; should really mean.</p><h2 id=viable-minimums-or-are-we-just-lowering-expectations>Viable Minimums? Or Are We Just Lowering Expectations?</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s give MVP its fair share of praises.</p><p>The MVP framework was designed to maximize <em>validated learning</em> as quickly as possible. And that&rsquo;s valuable — especially when you&rsquo;re exploring a foggy problem. Interviews are helpful, but watching a user click through a real interface reveals truths no survey ever will.</p><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t the theory. The issue is how MVP has been <em>culturally interpreted</em>.</p><p>Reid Hoffman famously advised founders to &ldquo;launch early enough that you&rsquo;re embarrassed by your v1.0 release.&rdquo; Startups - and even larger corporations - took that to heart. Too much, actually.</p><p>The result? As Jason Cohen puts it,</p><blockquote><p><strong>MVPs are too M and rarely V. Customers see that — and hate it.</strong></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Minimum&rdquo; became &ldquo;bare bones.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Viable&rdquo; became &ldquo;barely functional.&rdquo;<br>And users became unpaid QA testers.</p><p>As a hands-on engineer and product builder, I&rsquo;ve seen this firsthand. After launching MVP-styled features, real users would often come back saying: <em>&ldquo;This is interesting, but for it to be useful, it would need to do X&rdquo;</em>. That &ldquo;X&rdquo; was always something essential — something that should have been part of a complete first experience, not left for later iteration.</p><p>Yes, MVP still has a place — especially for proving unclear concepts or validating if a radical idea has any future at all. But for most modern software teams, especially when the user problem is well understood, MVP often leads to:</p><ul><li>high initial curiosity</li><li>underwhelmed first impressions</li><li>poor retention</li><li>avoidable churn</li></ul><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t build products to impress stakeholders with speed. We must build products because users have problems that deserve real solutions.</p><p>This is where <strong>SLC</strong> changes the conversation.</p><h2 id=slc-simple-lovable-complete>SLC: Simple, Lovable, Complete</h2><p><em>A more user-centered approach to product design</em></p><p>SLC is a mindset shift. Instead of asking:</p><p>➡️ <em>What&rsquo;s the minimum we can build to test this?</em></p><p>It asks:</p><p>➡️ <em>What&rsquo;s the simplest, complete product our users could actually love?</em></p><p>Where MVP optimizes for what <em>we</em> learn, SLC optimizes for what <em>they</em> experience.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break it down.</p><h3 id=simple>Simple</h3><p>SLC doesn&rsquo;t advocate for bigger releases. It advocates for <strong>cleaner, sharper focus</strong>.</p><p>By that, Simple means:</p><ul><li>A narrow problem</li><li>A tight scope</li><li>A product that&rsquo;s instantly understandable</li><li>Features that work without friction or cognitive load</li></ul><p>Simplicity is not about fewer features — it&rsquo;s about fewer <em>concepts</em>.</p><p>A simple SLC product feels like it was made by a team that deeply understands what matters and intentionally excluded everything that doesn&rsquo;t.</p><h3 id=lovable>Lovable</h3><p>Here we&rsquo;re getting to the essence of the problem, the real differentiator.</p><p>Instead of scrambling to ship a minimally functional set of screens, SLC pushes teams to create something a core group of users will <strong>love</strong>, talk about, and stick with.</p><p>&ldquo;Lovable&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t require fancy animations or pixel-perfect UI. It requires:</p><ul><li>An experience that feels thought-through</li><li>UX decisions that reflect real empathy</li><li>A workflow that solves the painful part <em>completely</em></li><li>A product that feels trustworthy, not experimental</li></ul><p>Instead of seeing users as co-developers, SLC treats them as recipients of value from day one — not beta testers.</p><h3 id=complete>Complete</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s where SLC rejects the typical MVP shortcuts.</p><p>Complete does <em>not</em> mean feature-rich. It means:</p><ul><li>No broken flows</li><li>No &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; placeholders</li><li>No dead ends or obvious gaps</li><li>A fully working, end-to-end value loop</li><li>Everything included in the scope is polished and reliable</li></ul><p>Users shouldn&rsquo;t have to imagine what the product <em>could</em> become. They should feel the value immediately and be eager to continue using it.</p><p>&ldquo;Complete&rdquo; basically means that <em>the limited scope we chose is delivered fully, thoughtfully, and without friction</em>.</p><p>This alone massively increases adoption and retention because users trust what feels consistent and reliable — even if it&rsquo;s small.</p><h2 id=a-better-user-centered-approach-to-building-products>A Better, User-Centered Approach to Building Products</h2><p><img src=/posts/slc-vs-mvp-products-users-love/images/mvp-slc_comparison.png alt="MVP vs SLC Comparison"></p><p>SLC doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success. No framework can. Only hard work, intuition and some sprinkles of luck.</p><p>But as Jason Cohen notes, SLC gives teams better odds <em>and</em> better options. If a SLC launch fails, you still learned something meaningful — and you didn&rsquo;t burn your first users with a half-baked product.</p><p>If it succeeds, you&rsquo;ve already delivered real value. Now you can:</p><ul><li>build a v2 based on what actual users — not early testers — want</li><li>take your time making thoughtful decisions</li><li>or decide the product is good enough as-is, without chasing endless feature expansion</li></ul><p>Not every product needs to become a ever-growing platform. Some things should remain simple, lovable, and complete — forever.</p><p>That being said, from my perspective, SLC shines when:</p><ul><li>the user problem is clear</li><li>the market is understood</li><li>the team has a strong product vision</li><li>and the goal is to build something users will adopt immediately, not &ldquo;eventually&rdquo;</li></ul><p>By focusing on simplicity, completeness, and emotional bonding, teams avoid building scaffolds of hypothetical features and instead deliver something that feels <em>real</em> from day one.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>MVP is not a bad idea, far from it. It&rsquo;s just been misused, misinterpreted, and over-applied.</p><p>SLC reminds us of something the MVP era made us forget:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Users deserve products, not prototypes.</strong><br><strong>They want solutions, not experiments.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And when teams aim for simple, complete, lovable experiences, they create products people talk about proudly, not patiently tolerate.</p><p>It&rsquo;s time to rethink our obsession with &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; and instead invest in the smallest product users can <em>love</em> — not the smallest product we can <em>ship</em>.</p></div><div class=prev-next><div class=prev-post><p><a href=/posts/2024-books/>&#8592;
