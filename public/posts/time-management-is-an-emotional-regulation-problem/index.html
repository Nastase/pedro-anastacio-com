I know I did. It&rsquo;s the most socially acceptable lie we tell. It sounds reasonable. Responsible, even. And it&rsquo;s kind of comfortable, as it suggests the problem is external — too many meetings, too many messages, too many demands. Not really my fault.</p><p>But when I look honestly at my days, that explanation collapses. I still have time to scroll, to switch between minor tasks. Time to stay busy just enough to feel productive.</p><p>The issue was never time. It is wasting it willingly because it&rsquo;s easier than what we should be really doing.</p><p>It is some kind of avoidance. Not dramatic avoidance. Quiet avoidance.</p><h2 id=procrastination-isnt-laziness-its-protection>Procrastination Isn’t Laziness, It’s Protection</h2><p>For a long time, I treated procrastination as a personal flaw. A lack of discipline. A motivation issue. Maybe even laziness. Obviously that framing never helped.</p><p>What helped was realizing that procrastination is mostly emotional, not logistical. It&rsquo;s a way of protecting ourselves from discomfort. From uncertainty, from possible failure, from confronting the gap between where we are and where we want to be.</p><p>Scrolling is easy, refining a system feels productive. In contrast, starting an uncomfortable task forces us to face competence, doubt, and responsibility. So, we take the easy route most of the time, often half-conscious of it.</p><p>And we delay, not because we don&rsquo;t care, but <strong>because we care enough to be afraid</strong>.</p><h2 id=why-better-systems-didnt-fix-it>Why Better Systems Didn’t Fix It</h2><p>Like many engineers, my first instinct was optimization. Let&rsquo;s create a better system, full of rules. Have more structured planning. And keep looking at new productivity frameworks. I could spend hours perfecting a system instead of spending 30 minutes doing the thing it was meant to support.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie. That helped — but only marginally.</p><p>Because systems don’t decide what we avoid. <strong>They only organize what we&rsquo;re willing to face.</strong></p><p>This is one of the quiet truths behind <em>Atomic Habits</em>, by James Clear: <strong>behavior follows identity</strong>. If part of us identifies as someone who avoids discomfort, no system will override that for long.</p><p>And in the end, we don&rsquo;t rise to the level of our tools. We fall to the level of our self-honesty.</p><h2 id=the-trade-we-make-without-noticing>The Trade We Make Without Noticing</h2><p>Every day, we make a trade that rarely feels like a decision. We favor short-term comfort in exchange for long-term regret.</p><p>The cost isn&rsquo;t immediate, which is why it works so well. We defer it to the future us, as if we are strangers we don&rsquo;t mind overworking. Problem solved.</p><p>Ten minutes here, a quick check there. Did I receive new messages on Teams? Let me do just one more small task before the important one.</p><p>By the end of the day, nothing obvious went wrong, and we actually did some tasks — except that the work that mattered didn&rsquo;t progress as it could have.</p><p>Regret and guilt don&rsquo;t arrive loudly. It accumulates silently. Until we feel miserable.</p><h2 id=impostor-syndrome-and-the-fear-of-real-work>Impostor Syndrome and the Fear of Real Work</h2><p>Day after day the cycle repeats. And it inevitably leads to another layer that&rsquo;s harder to admit: impostor syndrome thrives in distraction. As long as we&rsquo;re busy, we never have to test ourselves. As long as we&rsquo;re preparing, we never have to commit.</p><p>Deep, meaningful work is a threat to the person whose self-doubt is fueled by procrastination. Because when we face hard work, it forces a confrontation with reality. Can I actually do this? Am I as capable as I think? What if I fail when I truly try?</p><p>Avoidance isn&rsquo;t always about pleasure. Most of the time it&rsquo;s about self-preservation.</p><h2 id=time-as-a-mirror>Time as a Mirror</h2><p>Time doesn&rsquo;t judge. It repeatedly reflects what we give our attention to, and becomes evidence of what we value, regardless of what we <em>claim</em> to value.</p><p>We can try to manage time as we want, apply a shiny new system. But without a clear commitment to face our fears and a willingness to step outside our comfort zone, it will be of little to no use.</p><p>That realization was uncomfortable for me. It still is, leaving no space for excuses. Nor guilt. Nor pressure.</p><p>Just plain and honest ownership.</p></div><div class=prev-next><div class=prev-post><p><a href=/posts/slc-vs-mvp-products-users-love/>&#8592;
