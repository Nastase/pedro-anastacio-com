Not every one of them was good enough to remember, which is why I want to share with you two of the twenty-six that really resonated with me, one fiction and one non-fiction. Keep reading, and I'll tell you everything!</small><p class=post-date>January 17, 2025</p><ul class=post-tags><li class=post-tag><a href=https://pedroanastacio.com/tags/books>books</a></li></ul></div><div class=post-content><p><img src=/posts/2024-books/images/book_glasses.jpg alt="Empathic Leader"></p><p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading, and in 2024, I reached a personal milestone: I read a record total of 26 books. While not all of them were lengthy epics—some were shorter novellas—each book offered something unique. My reading choices spanned across thrillers and science-fiction to insightful non-fiction, primarily focused on productivity and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Among all the books I read last year, two stood out: <strong>&ldquo;The Murderbot Diaries&rdquo;</strong> in fiction (ok, this is a series, and I’m currently on volume five out of seven) and <strong>&ldquo;Working Backwards&rdquo;</strong> in non-fiction.</p><h2 id=fiction-the-murderbot-diaries-by-martha-wells>Fiction: &ldquo;The Murderbot Diaries&rdquo; by Martha Wells</h2><p><img src=/posts/2024-books/images/all-systems-red_martha-wells.jpg alt="All Systems Red - Martha Wells"></p><p>This series, that starts with <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B01MYZ8X5C?crid=24259DZNWKH7X&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RsoM5E7Fr28SpxeaybUBvTxoffXLVe76XcLgDLFO3qS9SbDMsiJb-Y1EDc784QVh1IW13uuHeXNCRk_VBHxt3g23mK2IKQYsXMKThPMlLZqK28DSx2wrPvf0vAXbg0hibeJoLtz3hRgMbdm8yF3eG8AlnQH4lHOmHNV1NpCTSLfl3DQn63qQV-BserKL8VJU8CevrfihUDBKiH-VQbKexH22B6Ns4-chk_JJrmy5d6U.FQ5MQh0b9spd2rewP1sS6irhJaFeAfJIfJieCVStbUM&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=all+systems+red&amp;qid=1737135452&amp;sprefix=all+systems+red%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1">All Systems Red</a></em>, follows Murderbot, a sentient security android that has hacked its own governor module, granting it independence over its previous owner, one of the ruthless companies operating in the Corporation Rim</p><p>Murderbot prefers the comfort of watching entertainment over interacting with humans (please do not try to touch it, you could provoke a stroke - I mean, if it had a real heart beating). However, it frequently finds itself entangled in human issues — often unwillingly solving problems and uncovering conspiracies along the way.</p><p>For me, what makes this series particularly compelling is its blend of action, humor, and introspection. Though Martha Wells writes in an accessible and fast-paced style, she delves into profound themes like:</p><ul><li><strong>Identity & Autonomy</strong> – How does one define themselves when external forces dictate their existence?</li><li><strong>Human-AI Relationships</strong> – Can trust exist between artificial intelligence and humans?</li><li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas</strong> – Who controls technology, and what are the implications of that control?</li></ul><p>Despite its lighthearted and entertaining tone, <em>The Murderbot Diaries</em> made me reflect on one&rsquo;s purpose, free will, and the implications of technological innovation, making it an absolute standout in my 2024 reading list.</p><h2 id=non-fiction-working-backwards-by-colin-bryar-and-bill-carr>Non-Fiction: &ldquo;Working Backwards&rdquo; by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr</h2><p><img src=/posts/2024-books/images/working-backwards_colin-bryar_bill-carr.jpg alt="Working Backwards - Colin Bryar and Bill Carr"></p><p>Recommended by my dear friend and former boss, <a href=https://birkholm-buch.dk/>Peter Birkholm-Buch</a>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets-ebook/dp/B08BYCQBZN?_encoding=UTF8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yvPFiNji6EJta2Nen7Fhq40A-wltJDiKPBLY_K16L-MzRKjAluXTEFO-VuyS2WkxcHzSl9f8g25eGsPevsDB0ubnw2VgldnpIFVCCyJC6cazYiE2paEyvVYupjILApYgzEmS-yiz1d7eBTArNBgFyZlt1ahu_zs4Qf87-W3-OrgXwnr_DSeOJgQ0K00lfnlOddE1ZcsyUjDP0ZotLSSBzMYbTmKqItdwqeSNDjLFxjE.O8ime48Gn0b18qEjAZmp1DzCH6XpIOS7NEzptNHu-30&amp;qid=1737135508&amp;sr=8-1">Working Backwards</a></em> provides an insightful, behind-the-scenes, look at Amazon’s rise from a small online bookstore to the global super-power it is today. Written by two longtime Amazon executives (or &ldquo;Amazonians,&rdquo; as they refer to themselves), the book serves as both a memoir and a business strategy guide, delving into Amazon’s leadership principles and operational methodologies.</p><p>The book excels at showcasing the pillars of Amazon’s success:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer Obsession</strong> – Every decision is centered on maximizing value for the customer.</li><li><strong>Operational Excellence</strong> – How Amazon enforces structured, data-driven strategies to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Innovation at Scale</strong> – Amazon fosters a culture of experimentation, where numerous ideas are tested, refined, or discarded before reaching the public.</li></ul><p>One of the book’s most valuable insights is the concept of <em>working backwards</em> (hence the book&rsquo;s name) — where the teams start with the desired customer outcome and design products or services to fulfill that vision. This methodology challenges conventional approaches, emphasizing intentional, well-researched, data-backed innovation.</p><p>This privileged peek at Amazon’s journey, Jeff Bezos’s mindset, and the company’s relentless pursuit of excellence, seen through the eyes and experience of two of the responsible for Amazon&rsquo;s huge success, has given me numerous insights and ideas, making me rethink how I approach problems and project execution.</p><p>Amongst all the books I read last year, both <em>The Murderbot Diaries</em> and <em>Working Backwards</em> left a significant impact on me, offering valuable lessons — one through the lens of an AI struggling with autonomy and his place in the universe, and the other through the story of a company redefining business innovation.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t read any of those, you should grab a copy <em>asap</em>!</p></div><div class=prev-next><div class=prev-post><p><a href=/posts/empathy-vs-strength/>&#8592;
