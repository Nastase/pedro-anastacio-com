&lt;p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading, and in 2024, I reached a personal milestone: I read a record total of 26 books. While not all of them were lengthy epics—some were shorter novellas—each book offered something unique. My reading choices spanned across thrillers and science-fiction to insightful non-fiction, primarily focused on productivity and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among all the books I read last year, two stood out: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;The Murderbot Diaries&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> in fiction (ok, this is a series, and I’m currently on volume five out of seven) and &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Working Backwards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> in non-fiction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Empathy is the New Strength in Leadership</title><link>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://pedroanastacio.com/posts/empathy-vs-strength/images/empathic-leader.jpg" alt="Empathic Leader">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once seen as the foundation of good leadership, authority and technical skills are gradually being perceived as the tools of &amp;ldquo;old school leaders&amp;rdquo;. Technical expertise in an area of expertise is still imensly valuable, but on the other hand, authority is being replaced by empathy. Often dismissed as a mere soft skill, empahty is now redefining what it means to lead effectively in modern organizations. And it’s becoming essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Résumé</title><link>https://pedroanastacio.com/work/resume/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pedroanastacio.com/work/resume/</guid><description>&lt;p>With over 20 years of experience across diverse industries such as telecommunications, banking, logistics, and healthcare, I have led high-impact projects, consistently delivering innovative, efficient, and scalable software solutions.
